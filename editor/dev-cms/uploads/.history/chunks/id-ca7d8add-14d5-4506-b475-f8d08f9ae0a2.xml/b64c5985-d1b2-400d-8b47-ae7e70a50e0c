SMS is the evaluated progress of the EnMS of the organization, OMS is the evaluated operation of the EnMS of the organization and TAS is the evaluated degree of energy objective achievement of the organization.NOTE 2 This document provides a method to measure any type and scale of organization (from energy intensive industries implementing advanced energy management to small and medium enterprises) on an objective scale. Also, using this document, the appropriateness and economic efficiency of the measurement method can be considered according to the amount of energy used.NOTE 1 Terms and concepts used in developing the EMPS based on this document do not provide an interpretation of the requirements of ISO 50001. There is no correspondence between the energy performance score measured by using the measurement methods in this document and the requirements of ISO 50001.By measuring the EMPS, it is expected that organizations can understand their current progress in energy management thereby they could aim to improve the EnMS, enabling continual improvement of energy performance. Comparison of energy performance improvement may be difficult between different types of organizations. This method of measurement can help an organization to understand their energy management progress. Also, it is possible that the organization can compare the status of their EnMS to that of other organizations and understand their relative energy management progress. Measuring energy management and energy performance is expected to guide organizations to more effective energy management.This document provides guidance on a method of measuring energy management progress associated with an energy management system (EnMS) using an Energy Management Progress Score (EMPS)." timestamp="1627653502992"?></sec>
