Energy target(s) can be related to energy savings or energy performance improvement. Energy savings can be calculated based on methods described in ISO 50047. Energy performance improvement can be calculated based on methods described in ISO 50006. These results are based on comparing between actual and expected energy consumption. The TAS score is selected from four kinds of score (A, B, C, D) according to comparison of indicators relative to targets. An energy performance target may be defined depending on an organizationsâ€™ energy consumption or depending on benchmarks defined the government or the industry group.The requirements of ISO 50001:2018 related to operational elements of energy performance improvement are selected as evaluation items for OMS. The result is determined at four levels (A, B, C, D). This evaluation item includes management of actions to improve energy performance, measurement and management of energy performance, operation of facilities/equipment associated with SEUs, and design and procurement related to SEUs and energy supply.Items related to structure of an EnMS from ISO 50001 are selected as evaluation items for SMS scoring. The SMS result is determined at four levels of score (A, B, C, D), A being the highest and D the lowest score." timestamp="1627655767374"?></body>
