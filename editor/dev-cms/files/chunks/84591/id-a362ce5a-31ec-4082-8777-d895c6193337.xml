Stereotypical masculine role perceptions can have negative impacts on the lives, health, including mental health, of men and boys. This is why, in order to address gender inequality, it is important to identify how a particular organisational action or omission affects gender equality. Only once this has been done can the gender imbalance be identified, and the appropriate action to address that imbalance be determined.

In order to address gender inequality, it is important that we first identify how a particular organisational action or omission affects those of different genders. Only once this has been done can the gender imbalance be identified, and the appropriate action to address that imbalance be determined. This is an underlying principle of this standard. It should not be assumed that one particular gender is more likely than another to be disadvantaged in a particular situation. It may, for example, be that there are instances in which an organisation identifies that the needs specific to men are not fully addressed and that action is required to address this. However, despite the real progress that has been made, it is undoubtedly the case that gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls still remain disproportionately prevalent in all walks of life and in every country.It aims to provide support in the fulfilment of their legal obligations, or going beyond them, by proposing an approach, methods and operational tools.
