This training may be extended to include the occupational health and social services. The training should address the legal obligations and propose models of actions.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="ad50ba29-09e1-421d-b2de-2f4760ba3c89"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="9276395" change-id="45d94a6a-bf5a-4222-fab2-422e029b9d62" timestamp="1671534924829"?>—    After the training, a whistleblowing, reporting and investigation procedure may be set up in coordination with the workforce representatives. This system may include the creation of reporting and advice units (depending on the size of the organization) managed by a trained and well-informed person or a trained and well-informed group of people, or the provision of a dedicated telephone number or e-mail account that guarantees the confidentiality of information provided by victims/survivors and witnesses. In addition, systematic questions on sexual and gender-based violence can be included in the template used for the organization’s annual reviews with the workforce.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="45d94a6a-bf5a-4222-fab2-422e029b9d62"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="9276395" change-id="79692965-15c4-4951-af6c-f4145c72af68" timestamp="1671534924829"?>—    Finally, a procedure should be defined to address the claims made. By way of example, it may use interview guidelines for the victims/survivors, the offenders and the witnesses, and a scale of sanctions depending on the event (sexual harassment = serious misconduct = dismissal).<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="79692965-15c4-4951-af6c-f4145c72af68"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="9276395" change-id="43391730-2050-4dfc-fb75-90c87ebd4e07" timestamp="1671534924829"?>—    The organization should take measures to protect the victims/survivors during the internal investigation. For example, systematic consultation of the occupation health service and the transfer of the presumed offender to another department. The organization can also refer the victims/survivors to external resources to provide support with legal formalities and psychosocial care, e.g., psychologists or specialized associations. A “contact box” of external resources may be used.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="43391730-2050-4dfc-fb75-90c87ebd4e07"?></p></sec>
