A survivor-centred approach entails to detail information about a variety of safe and confidential spaces for workforce and bystanders to have access to information and support, to raise concerns and make complaints that assures confidentiality and protection (ILO Convention 190, Article 9e<xref ref-type="fn" as:rid="chunks/id-c4e0cb21-0b34-4895-8296-811fdea5592a#id-338b489e-4c46-4a2d-8036-a46a3f898081" id="id-7efeb2e7-70b6-4bed-f7f4-3c8aea522fe2" xmlns:as="http://niso-sts-authoring-solution/authoring-schema"><?fontoxml-text-placeholder text="type the link text"?></xref><fn id="id-338b489e-4c46-4a2d-8036-a46a3f898081"><p>The International Labour Organization is a United Nations Agency with a tripartite structure (Governments, workers and employers) that was established for the purpose of setting International Labour Standard. These minimum standards are legal instruments setting out Universal Basic Principles and right to work and are intended to prevent unfair competition based on exploitation and abuse. The ILO seeks to promote opportunities for women as well as men to obtain decent and productive work, which is defined as work perform in the conditions of freedom, equality, security and human dignity.</p><p><?fontoxml-text-placeholder text="type the footnote"?></p></fn>). Cases are to be recorded, investigated/acted upon by a trained individual, follow-up support provided and monitored. Victim/Survivor-centred approach – an approach in which the victim/survivor’s wishes, safety, and well-being remain a priority in all matters and procedures.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="1adc5f6f-d5c3-4f45-beed-0c2165864cdc"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="9276395" change-id="e16a5852-e869-4fde-853b-5f29eebfabc4" timestamp="1671534194446"?>B) By-stander intervention. In a study on grievance mechanism on sexual harassment by Harvard Review it was found that SHPs should include bystander interventions as a required response to predatory sexual behaviour. Most policies place responsibility for reporting harassment exclusively on the target, which puts them in a vulnerable position. Mandating bystander intervention can relieve the target of their sole responsibility of creating a healthier organizational culture on all members of the organisation.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="e16a5852-e869-4fde-853b-5f29eebfabc4"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="9276395" change-id="3f50e96a-637f-42df-d7fe-1db090d9ab7f" timestamp="1671534194446"?>C)It is crucial that penalties and discipline are proportionate to the identified misconduct.. Extreme penaltiesand disciplinary measures can reduce people’s willingness to report GBV. Similarly, minor penalties or disciplinary responses to large breaches of the policy can undermine the workplace message on preventing SEAH.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="3f50e96a-637f-42df-d7fe-1db090d9ab7f"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="9276395" change-id="233c8d34-411e-4708-d585-12121dd42e75" timestamp="1671534194446"?>D) Set up a referral mechanism. This can include a predefined list of organisations or institutions who can provide psychosocial, legal, financial, and medical support services for the victim/survivor of GBV. Women’s organization often have a good overview of what types of support exist and where to get it, sometimes women’s organisations provide such support mechanism. What is central is that the organisations have a victim/survivor-based approach.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="233c8d34-411e-4708-d585-12121dd42e75"?></p><?fontoxml-change-deletion author-id="9276395" change-id="f3e0dfb6-88a8-4a7c-88c2-061ae9243308" text="—    a procedure to address the claims made.—    creation of a whistle-blowing, reporting and investigation procedure (see ISO 37002:2021 for guidelines on whistleblowing management system)—    communication and information;—    training;—    awareness-raising;—    risk assessment;A number of issues have to be identified and prioritized in order to highlight the subject of sexual and gender-based violence and to create a common culture:" timestamp="1671534193625"?><p/></sec>
