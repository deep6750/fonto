It provides the means of learning about gender through family, the times they live in, traditions and the education system. In this way, young children can understand the importance of equality for all human beings, without distinction. They will gradually become able to describe different notions, such as violence and discrimination, by reflecting more and more objectively how to measure actions (insults, contempt, aggression, etc.). Teaching equality enables youngsters to understand that equality is not possible as long as any forms of discrimination and violence exist. Finally, as these children grow up, they will come to perceive equality as a social construct based on the responsibility of all.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="dfd2aede-fa94-4f72-c75b-33649991762c"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="5191008" change-id="461655e7-d467-4324-b201-2dba4dc5539f" timestamp="1667311545000"?>Several examples can be given that demonstrate how learning to live together is of the utmost importance for children under six:<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="461655e7-d467-4324-b201-2dba4dc5539f"?></p><list list-type="dash"><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="5191008" change-id="0e266040-5566-49fa-f53b-8602cf03e9f9" timestamp="1667311545000"?><list-item id="id-d661fd40-dc44-4abf-9ec7-f8c03f70166b"><p>Theme-based posters explaining the rules governing society and, by extension, the rules that apply in the classroom.

In this way, young children can discover values such as human dignity, freedom of choice, equality between girls and boys, solidarity, the spirit of justice and the rejection of discrimination.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="5afd68ea-da57-4452-e65d-bb82b392201d"?></p><p/></sec>
