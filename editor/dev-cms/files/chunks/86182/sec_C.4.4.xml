If at least two of the determined values do not differ by more than 1 dB, further measurements are not necessary; otherwise the measurements shall be continued until two values differing by no more than 1 dB are obtained. The emission sound pressure level is the arithmetic mean of the two highest values that do not differ by more than 1 dB.</p><p>The microphone position at the ear where the time-averaged A-weighted sound pressure level is the higher shall be taken into account.</p></sec>
