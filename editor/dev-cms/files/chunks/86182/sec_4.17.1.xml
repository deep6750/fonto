Hence, the test conditions of <xref as:rid="chunks/86182/sec_C.xml#sec_C" ref-type="app" id="sec_C">AnnexÂ C</xref> are designed to give a value which is repeatable and only conditionally comparable with values obtained in a real operation. The operator's significant exposure to noise and vibration occurs during drilling.</p><non-normative-note><label>NOTE</label><p>Driving and tramming are of short duration and therefore has little or no influence on the total noise emission and vibration exposure.</p></non-normative-note></sec>
