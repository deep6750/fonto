A suitably designed falling objects protective structure (FOPS) in accordance with <xref as:rid="chunks/86182/sec_4.2.4.1#tab_1" ref-type="table" id="tab_1">Table 1</xref> shall be provided over part of the platform. The FOPS may be adjustable taking into account the various functions to be performed from the platform.</p><p>Rigs equipped with boom-mounted working platforms shall comply with <std std-id="iso:std:iso:16368:en" type="undated"><std-ref>ISO 16368</std-ref></std> but are exempted from the following requirements of <std std-id="iso:std:iso:16368:en" type="undated"><std-ref>ISO 16368</std-ref></std>:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><label>a)</label><p>providing a device that prevents driving of the rig when the boom-mounted platform is not in its transport position;</p></list-item><list-item><label>b)</label><p>providing a device that prevents movement of the platform while the stabilizers are not set;</p></list-item><list-item><label>c)</label><p>providing a device that prevents adjustment of the stabilizers while the boom-mounted platform is not in its transport position;</p></list-item><list-item><label>d)</label><p>providing a device, located in the operators compartment, that indicates that the boom-mounted platform is not in its transport position;</p></list-item><list-item><label>e)</label><p>providing a load sensing system;</p></list-item><list-item><label>f)</label><p>providing an adjustment for uneven ground for base plates on stabilizing jacks.</p></list-item></list><non-normative-note><label>NOTE</label><p>The exemptions are justified for the following reasons:</p><p>a)   the primary function of the stabilizers is for use during drilling;</p><p>b)   the need to manoeuvre in narrow tunnels;</p><p>c)   risk of rock fall;</p><p>d)   the size and weight of the machine.</p></non-normative-note><p>The boom-mounted working platform shall be operable from both the platform and the operator's station. Only one control position shall be active at a time except for stop controls and emergency stop. In case of emergency, for example rock fall, it shall be possible to override the controls of the platform by the control at the operator’s station.</p><p>Overturning of a rig for underground use and equipped with a boom-mounted working platform, due to overload of the platform, is not considered a significant hazard due to the size and weight of the rig. However, overload of the boom and platform shall be prevented by restricting the platform size according to <std std-id="iso:std:iso:16368:en" type="undated"><std-ref>ISO 16368</std-ref></std>, or by mechanical, hydraulic or electronic protection systems. The platform shall be subject to a static load test according to <std std-id="iso:std:iso:16368:en" type="undated"><std-ref>ISO 16368</std-ref></std>.</p><p>Any overload prevention system fitted shall not prevent the platform from being lowered.</p></sec>
