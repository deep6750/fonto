The stability shall be verified by calculation.</p><p>The stability criteria and calculations given in <xref as:rid="chunks/86182/sec_B.2.xml#sec_B.2" ref-type="sec" id="sec_B.2">B.2</xref> refer to mobile and stationary rigs but are not applicable to rigs fixed to the ground or a foundation. For those rigs the moments from weights and forces shall be taken into account when calculating and designing the anchoring of the rig.</p><p>The stability angles, <italic>α</italic>, as defined in <xref as:rid="chunks/86182/sec_B.2.xml#sec_B.2" ref-type="sec" id="sec_B.2">B.2</xref> shall not be less than 10° in any directions when tramming and be not less than 5° under any other conditions.</p><p>When the rig is intended to work, tram or be parked on a plane deviating from the horizontal, the verification of stability shall include the maximum allowed slope angle under the most unfavourable conditions as specified and stated in the operator's instructions. The stability angle shall comply with the above mentioned limits, i.e. the safety margin of 10° and 5° respectively shall be added to the specified operational slope angle. The margins above take into account the dynamic effects such as accelerating and braking.</p><p>Instructions on stability and other essential restrictions of use which are of immediate importance shall be given on signs clearly visible at the driver's and operator's position, e.g. maximum allowed gradient angle for slopes when tramming or drilling.</p><p>Detailed instructions regarding the restrictions and special measures to be taken when drilling, tramming or parking shall be given in the operator's instructions, see 6.5.4.2.</p></sec>
