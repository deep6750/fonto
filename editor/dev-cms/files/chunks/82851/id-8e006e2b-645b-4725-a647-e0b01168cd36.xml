Protection involves one or more constraints that are to be applied to specific data that are expected to provide the safeguard that is appropriate. It should be noted that the actual sensitivity of the data to be protected may be of national or cultural expectation, and need not be consistent. It should also be noted that in modelling, specific data fields are labelled with the protection that is to be provided, but that it is for the FSV implementation to determine how such protection requirements are given technical effect. In this standard only the means of determining the agreed (or required) protection that is attaching to specified individual data elements (fields and records) is addressed.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="466ab869-415a-4b9b-c44d-4799c421fc38"?></p><p/></sec>
