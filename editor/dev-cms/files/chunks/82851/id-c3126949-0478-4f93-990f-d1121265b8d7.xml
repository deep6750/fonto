A second fundamental aspect here is that any Person (or whatever nature) shall do so in compliance with applicable external constraints of the relevant jurisdictional domain.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="551f1ae1-b63f-40ff-84c3-b337756c31d6"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="fbbcce2d-ea1c-4a0d-bfec-13f3ed28df37" timestamp="1627509212073"?>A key characteristic of Open-edi is that "parties control and maintain their states". {See Clause 5.4, in ISO/IEC 15944-1}. As such, it is important to know whether or not the value of a SRI once recorded and possibly interchanged among parties to a learning transaction is allowed to be changed during any stage in the process component.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="fbbcce2d-ea1c-4a0d-bfec-13f3ed28df37"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="336983a7-1c9e-4b6f-8c62-88a4cdf9deae" timestamp="1627509212073"?><bold>Knowing whether or not state changes are allowed for a specific SRI is important for the management in the IT systems of state description and automated change management of the state machines of the parties involved in an (electronic) learning transaction.</bold><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="336983a7-1c9e-4b6f-8c62-88a4cdf9deae"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="e79d783f-93bf-4dd3-c342-8b98c4ca9ac5" timestamp="1627509212073"?>This is a requirement which also exists in modelling learning transactions involving internal constraints only. However, those which exist here are likely to be a sub-set of those which arise from external constraints.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="e79d783f-93bf-4dd3-c342-8b98c4ca9ac5"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="6ecfd681-eb09-4810-9c71-0738ee6ee15b" timestamp="1627509212073"?>A related issue is that of “What happens to recorded information which existed prior to a state change being made”? It is important here for parties to a learning transaction to know this. In summary, two attributes are required to specify state change of data. They are:<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="6ecfd681-eb09-4810-9c71-0738ee6ee15b"?></p><list list-type="order"><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="21ef3711-7805-4299-9e59-811f0df26a0e" timestamp="1627509212073"?><list-item><p>number of state changes allowed, if any; and,</p></list-item><list-item><p>store change type.</p></list-item><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="21ef3711-7805-4299-9e59-811f0df26a0e"?></list><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="eb51a166-af26-4ae4-e6c7-ac7cc55cd4b4" timestamp="1627509212073"?>The inter-working of these two attributes, i.e., as codes in two coded domains, covers the various combinations of state changes in the data value for SRI pertaining to the personal information of an individual learner as well as what actions are required of a LET provider with respect to both “new” and “old” data including those required for information life cycle management (ILCM) within an organization, audit trains, evidentiary requirements and any external constraints of this nature of jurisdictional domains.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="eb51a166-af26-4ae4-e6c7-ac7cc55cd4b4"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="64cf6e92-85c1-4a7b-dac3-31d3f7eb0b08" timestamp="1627509212073"?>The coded domains presented below address the most primitive, i.e., essential, requirements of specifying and managing state changes (at whatever level of granularity) of SRIs in an IT system. Their primary focus is to be directed at ensuring that public policy requirements are able to be supported especially in the IT systems of a LET provider.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="64cf6e92-85c1-4a7b-dac3-31d3f7eb0b08"?></p><p/></sec>
