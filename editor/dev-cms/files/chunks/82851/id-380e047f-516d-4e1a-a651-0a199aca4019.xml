Privacy/data protection is part of a set of public policy requirements which include consumer protection, individual accessibility, human rights, etc.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="e2835957-0e09-46d8-e751-8f945b0ecf65"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="472d30cd-b840-48c2-b602-9f11e39a6a79" timestamp="1627508693031"?>Further, there are also generic legal requirements which pertain to any sets of recorded information (SRIs) interchanged among parties to a learning transaction. These include record retention requirements, those of an evidentiary nature, archiving, contingency/disaster planning, etc., a.k.a., “information law” requirements, governing information management and data interchange of an organization.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="472d30cd-b840-48c2-b602-9f11e39a6a79"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="f11b72a2-2b89-475f-ed56-bb67860672d6" timestamp="1627508693031"?>The purpose of this Annex C is to consolidate these operational view requirements (including those of an external constraint nature) into a single set of high level or “primitive” principles. Having such a short Annex in ISO/IEC 29187-1 (including the concept and definition of “information law”) will facilitate the further development of Part 1 Framework and Reference Model as well as its additional Parts 2+. This is because these ILCM principles will provide a generic context and reference for information management and data interchange requirements including those required to support privacy protection requirements.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="f11b72a2-2b89-475f-ed56-bb67860672d6"?></p><p/></sec>
