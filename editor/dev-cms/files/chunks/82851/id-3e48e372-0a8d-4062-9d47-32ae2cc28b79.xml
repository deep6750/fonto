The LET transaction – Privacy Protection - Framework and Reference Model is learning transaction focused, rule-based, and conformant to the generic ISO/IEC 14662 Open-edi Reference Model. It maximizes re-use of existing ISO standards including applicable concepts and their definitions. LET privacy protection requirements are placed in the generic context of applicable public policy requirements, those pertaining to establishment and management of identities of an individual learner, as well as state changes and records retention requirements of personal information on or about an individual learner. This standard also incorporates best practices and policies as have already been implemented in LET environments in support of privacy protection requirements.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="71c04d12-a792-4d84-813c-dc794e125678"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="e69504cb-0188-4ac6-84d8-7fc470bbe165" timestamp="1626986917737"?>This document does not specify the technical mechanisms, i.e., functional support services (FSV) which are required to support LOV-identified requirements.
