This kind of organization may find itself (and particular its officers) being subject to legal action for not exercising stewardship, due diligence, damages, etc., for not implementing these requirements (which in turn form part of the implementation of ILCM principles).</p></fn></sup> which is a major asset of any LET provider. No LET provider should keep recorded information on its learning transaction or its clients which is not accurate or out-of-date, especially in the DMAs of its IT systems. As such for this generally accepted set of internal constraint on recorded information applicable to all parties to a learning transaction, LET providers concluding learning transactions with individual learners, should have no difficulties in support the external constraint of “accuracy” of a privacy protection nature (including in the DMAs of their IT systems).<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="342c2e80-31c0-45ad-fab1-89a527038e17"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="2e865a84-13c3-4392-98c0-8cdca25d4169" timestamp="1627498721007"?><bold>Rule 026:</bold><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="2e865a84-13c3-4392-98c0-8cdca25d4169"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="043bc707-3dc0-4d98-ab64-65eb0c4f47cd" timestamp="1627498721007"?><bold>Personal information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the specified purposes for which it was collected in support of the learning transaction.</bold><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="043bc707-3dc0-4d98-ab64-65eb0c4f47cd"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="c1207f10-a5f1-4006-864c-7e0b8da829e6" timestamp="1627498721007"?>The scenario definition shall make it clear that the data identified shall subsequently be capable of amendment (including deletion).
