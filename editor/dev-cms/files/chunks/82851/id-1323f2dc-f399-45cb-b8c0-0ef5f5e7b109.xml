It is for the surrounding LOV and LET-FSV processes to identify what the use implications are, and how the ‘informed consent’ status for the learning transaction has been achieved. However, it is clearly necessary for scenarios to develop the granularity of what the informed consent being given actually is for. It is possible that different data in a single transaction could be of different “informed consent” use; however, this standard addresses the simplest case of all of the data to the transaction being subject to the single ‘informed consent’ agreement.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="369f0cb7-8f40-4606-82ce-ab50a4df5b46"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="e07625c7-edd6-4917-e866-200273ecf96b" timestamp="1627500688672"?>It is noted that in a substantial number of learning transaction, the individual learner remains for all practical purposes “anonymous”.
