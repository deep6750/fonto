Commitment is the making or accepting of a right, an obligation, liability or responsibility by a Person. In the context of a learning transaction, the making of commitments pertains to the transfer of a LET good, service and/or right among the Persons involved. In the past and still to a large extent today, the individual learner and the LET provider share the same jurisdictional domain. The advent of the Internet, online, distance, mobile, etc., learning has the result that parties to a learning transaction are often located in differing jurisdictional domains.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="0bb9203f-7c2a-4ccc-a960-f5944aa06837"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="ce41b2bc-bcf5-4528-9596-b4b35ac06fb0" timestamp="1627510386745"?>Consequently, it is not an uncommon occurrence depending on the goal and nature of the learning transaction that the Persons (and parties associated) are in different jurisdictional domains, and that, therefore, multiple sets of external constraints apply and overlap will occur. It is also not an uncommon occurrence that there is overlap among such sets of external constraints and/or conflict among them. This is also the case with respect to laws and regulations of a privacy protection nature. Resolving issues of this nature is outside the scope of this standard.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="ce41b2bc-bcf5-4528-9596-b4b35ac06fb0"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="f263c219-db7a-4502-a583-75986f77648e" timestamp="1627510386745"?>However, the modelling of learning transaction as scenarios and scenario components as re-useable business objects may well serve as a useful methodology for identifying specific overlaps and conflicts (thereby serving as a tool for their harmonization).<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="f263c219-db7a-4502-a583-75986f77648e"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="4f88fe21-2c41-412c-ca60-f364757c7be3" timestamp="1627510386745"?>As such, the Open-edi descriptive techniques methodologies and constructs, can serve as a tool in harmonization and simplification of external constraints arising from jurisdictional domains.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="4f88fe21-2c41-412c-ca60-f364757c7be3"?></p><non-normative-note><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="b1868b84-03e1-4c79-affe-74a0e6b00fb1" timestamp="1627821611405"?>This 2nd edition of Part 1 is based on the following assumptions:<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="b1868b84-03e1-4c79-affe-74a0e6b00fb1"?></p><list list-type="order"><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="88dec145-3c39-4e8a-ed5a-7204c5b31e6b" timestamp="1627821611405"?><list-item><p>the privacy protection requirements of the individual learner, as a buyer in a learning transaction, are those of the jurisdictional domain in which the individual made the commitments associated with the instantiated learning transaction; and,</p></list-item><list-item><p>where the LET provider is in a jurisdictional domain other than that of the individual leaner, this 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of Part 8 incorporates and supports the generic common privacy protection requirements which are expressed in eleven principles in Clause 5.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="88dec145-3c39-4e8a-ed5a-7204c5b31e6b"?></p></list-item></list></non-normative-note><?fontoxml-change-deletion author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="646e151e-32bf-45a9-9fe0-3cc4651a43a7" text="the privacy protection requirements of the individual learner, as a buyer in a learning transaction, are those of the jurisdictional domain in which the individual made the commitments associated with the instantiated learning transaction; and,where the LET provider is in a jurisdictional domain other than that of the individual leaner, this 2nd edition of Part 8 incorporates and supports the generic common privacy protection requirements which are expressed in eleven principles in Clause 5." timestamp="1627821604801"?><p/></sec>
