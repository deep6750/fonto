By way of example, the “receipt of a sale” between a buyer and seller contains exactly the same information with respect to:<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="65e9e507-e5c5-446f-8d26-a7bd2fe5bfdc"?></p><list list-type="order"><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="6c2d76f8-1538-40b6-c51b-e71913708240" timestamp="1627509900898"?><list-item id="id-425e1ab5-fe3d-4256-eb4e-5a31d9eac3db"><p>the learning transaction identifier (BTI);</p></list-item><list-item id="id-e1b82fac-052a-4702-e54f-9938ea08315c"><p>date (and time) of sale, i.e., the date of the instantiated learning transaction;</p></list-item><list-item id="id-60bf1c94-822c-48b7-9542-c70c3cd4c93e"><p>the price paid (often before and then including applicable taxes);</p></list-item><list-item id="id-9bc2e547-4ccf-4173-97d1-96a312a4d49f"><p>identification (at various levels of granularity) of what was purchased/sold</p></list-item><list-item id="id-1ba50f3e-3cd8-4b24-f110-20af19440fa6"><p>the means and mode of payment;</p></list-item><list-item id="id-8b0efac5-9600-41c6-af38-e0c8dd0fd7a1"><p>conditions, warranties, rebates, etc., as applicable; and,</p></list-item><list-item id="id-3a520392-0d30-462d-ebc9-92b36f8fe067"><p>any other documentation provided (including that as part of the packaging, recorded information in the packaging, or “online” via the Internet, including where it is a “virtual” LET good, service and/or right being transacted).</p></list-item><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="6c2d76f8-1538-40b6-c51b-e71913708240"?></list><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="41d0c4e1-0f0c-4f31-9d92-9f34a1d2e20d" timestamp="1627509900898"?>The purpose of business process modelling in the Open-edi context is to model the recorded information exchanged among the two primary Persons to a learning transaction. In that context there are two roles of Person, one assuming the role of “buyer” and the other the role of “seller”, and the focus is on the information bundles that are being interchanged among these two primary partners in the learning transaction.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="41d0c4e1-0f0c-4f31-9d92-9f34a1d2e20d"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="5a7a3068-8ebe-4e8a-8270-42d81fb195e0" timestamp="1627509900898"?>From an Open-edi perspective, the collaboration space is a view of transactions that take place <underline>outside</underline> the internal control space of the Persons which are parties to a learning transaction. This view sees both interchanges of information, i.e., from seller to buyer and buyer to seller as conceptually similar. Such a perspective is quite different than that of the view taken from <underline>inside</underline> of an organization.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="5a7a3068-8ebe-4e8a-8270-42d81fb195e0"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="ed368e70-e80a-4f5b-e858-688afdfb0449" timestamp="1627509900898"?>For Open-edi collaboration modelling, internal processes are not relevant until a resource as an information flow (or represented by it via a reference tag) crosses an organization’s logical boundaries. This independent perspective is the focus of Open-edi and is represented by collaboration space where values in the form of sets of recorded information (SRIs) are interchanged among the parties to a learning transaction.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="ed368e70-e80a-4f5b-e858-688afdfb0449"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="c1de025a-a409-46de-921c-d33347de34f7" timestamp="1627775498887"?>This is illustrated in <xref as:rid="chunks/82851/id-0fde8368-90ab-4c3e-9511-345eed4d74bf.xml#id-f83ea22a-98a6-4b30-bd97-cc6db1dce842" ref-type="fig" id="id-529ce221-bffa-4ad7-b15d-096a33e3ac4d" xmlns:as="http://niso-sts-authoring-solution/authoring-schema"><?fontoxml-text-placeholder text="type the link text"?></xref>below (taken from Figure E.4 “Concept of a Business Collaboration” in ISO/IEC 15944-4).<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="c1de025a-a409-46de-921c-d33347de34f7"?></p><fig id="id-f83ea22a-98a6-4b30-bd97-cc6db1dce842" specific-use="size:M"><caption><title><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="e41fe028-5bab-4ade-f3be-be4db8c5a854" timestamp="1627775483773"?>Concept of a business collaboration<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="e41fe028-5bab-4ade-f3be-be4db8c5a854"?></title></caption><graphic xlink:href="images/82851/E4" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></fig><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="0c3be4fd-6e6f-49e1-f0b6-fce0705b97a0" timestamp="1627509900898"?>The key and distinguishing aspect of the concept of collaboration space is that of providing an “independent view” from that of the specific views of each of the parties to a commitment exchange. In the ISO/IEC 15944-4 standard which focuses on “accounting and economic ontology” the parties to the collaboration space in support of the establishment of a commitment exchange, instantiated as a transaction, are “trading partners” and the application field is that of a “business transaction”.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="0c3be4fd-6e6f-49e1-f0b6-fce0705b97a0"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="ef6bd4af-93c3-423a-96b9-e3217a9b2453" timestamp="1627509900898"?>In this ISO/IEC 29187-1 <italic>Framework and Reference Model</italic> which focuses on a learning, education, and training (LET) context, the (primary) parties to the collaboration space in support of the establishment of a commitment exchange, is instantiated as a transaction, are the individual learner and the LET provider and the application field is that of a “learning transaction”.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="ef6bd4af-93c3-423a-96b9-e3217a9b2453"?></p><p/></sec>
