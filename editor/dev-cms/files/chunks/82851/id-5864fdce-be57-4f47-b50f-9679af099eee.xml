timestamp="1627508597324"?>The class of "internal constraints" has been derived to provide a simplified view of learning transactions for which there are no external constraints or restrictions to the nature and conduct of the transaction. The only constraints are those mutually agreed to by the buyer and LET provider for the explicitly stated goal of the learning transaction, i.e., they are self-imposed. This allows one to build scenarios and scenario components for referencing, registering and re-use as generic or base scenarios without having to include potential external constraints. The rules governing specification of Open-edi scenarios and their components require that all applicable external constraints must be stated at the time of instantiation but need not exist at the time of registration. {See further, Clause 9 in ISO/IEC 15944-1:2010 and its Annex I}<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="5527227a-8cc8-4bf8-d490-892cc572bf0a"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="6bd3efaf-5807-40a2-d521-7eda22228780" timestamp="1627508597324"?>However, in most learning transactions, external constraints do apply, i.e., applicable laws and regulations. These range from education related regulation and professional requirements; health and safety or packaging and labelling requirements; ensuring that nature of the learning transaction and/or the goods or services delivered do not comprise behaviour of a criminal nature. Whilst laws and regulations exist within and among jurisdictions and are the primary source of "external constraints" on learning transactions, categorization and specification of sub-classes of external constraints is outside the scope of this standard.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="6bd3efaf-5807-40a2-d521-7eda22228780"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="250d85d2-3239-4bc8-9911-f8120b05ec0f" timestamp="1627508597323"?>External constraints exist which are horizontal in nature.

In addition, some external constraints can be common to two or more sectors and supported through common standards. Sectoral constraints are found in LET, telecommunications, transportation and delivery, financial/banking, import/export restrictions specific to a good or service, inter-or intra-state trade, and so on. Where a sector imposes specific ways of conducting learning transactions within itself and with other sectors, such sector specific constraints and conditions must be identified and specified where applicable, as part of specification of scenarios and scenario components.<xref ref-type="fn" as:rid="chunks/82851/id-5864fdce-be57-4f47-b50f-9679af099eee.xml#id-e2c94cd9-fd7d-41cd-fbf8-476b661055b5" id="id-5a9a3f5f-b2f2-4e52-f089-d72b5f64c0c2" xmlns:as="http://niso-sts-authoring-solution/authoring-schema"><?fontoxml-text-placeholder text="type the link text"?></xref><fn id="id-e2c94cd9-fd7d-41cd-fbf8-476b661055b5"><p>A useful characteristic of external constraints is that at the sectorial level, national and international focal points, recognized authorities often already exist.

These rules are normally imposed by a particular sector on the others. For example, the banking sector may impose certain rules for the exchange of financial information between itself and other sectors. Sometimes the rules are established to enhance or facilitate services of a particular sector with others. The transportation sector is a good example.
