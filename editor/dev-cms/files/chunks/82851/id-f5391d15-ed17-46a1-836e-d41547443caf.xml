Thus, there is the need for a systematic approach to the management of identities. Published work seems to focus on the Functional Services View (FSV) aspects, i.e., the “How to” without first defining the business operational views (BOV) requirements, i.e., the “WHATs”. In this standard, this is the Learning Operational View (LOV). This section focuses on the “WHATs”. In addition to addressing the establishment, management, and use of identities of an individual based on external constraints, this section focuses on supporting external constraints of a privacy protection nature.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="d7037471-3e76-4a7e-c133-3e70ccef61a6"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="24c87527-9846-457d-acdb-9fc12f0d8612" timestamp="1628781237007"?>The concept of “identity management”, or better phrased “management of identity(ies)” of an entity, is viewed differently from various perspectives.
