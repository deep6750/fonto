This also applies to learning transactions. This internal constraints perspective is qualified where external constraints exist especially those imposed by jurisdictional domains.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="2f8fb51d-abe0-4d70-e400-85f7e81163ae"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="57233195-9adc-45d0-ebe1-5b337f70c5f2" timestamp="1627507023604"?>However, one result of the application of external constraints is that a Person is not free to choose and negotiate the nature of the Person identify (Pi) to be used in a learning transaction, including the persona forming part of the Pi. Based on the external constraints applicable to the learning transaction, a Person may be required to use a persona which is legally recognized, i.e., has the properties and behaviour of a “legally recognized name (LRN)”. This requirement is addressed in Clause 6.6.2.3 <italic>“Personae as legally recognized names (LRNs)”</italic> ISO/IEC 15944-5. The rules stated in this Clause 6.6.2.3 from a generic Person perspective also apply to ISO/IEC 29187-1.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="57233195-9adc-45d0-ebe1-5b337f70c5f2"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="78925fda-ce4f-4d4d-d78e-7fa7d702e80e" timestamp="1627507023604"?><bold>Rule 067:</bold><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="78925fda-ce4f-4d4d-d78e-7fa7d702e80e"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="4f971590-ccba-4389-a003-4a8312f8fc25" timestamp="1627507023604"?><bold>The rules in Clause 6.6.2.3 “<italic>Personae as legally recognized names (LRNs</italic>)”, as stated in ISO/IEC 15944-5, also apply in this standard.</bold><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="4f971590-ccba-4389-a003-4a8312f8fc25"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="d61662b5-d470-4fce-e554-c51669b695f5" timestamp="1627507023604"?><bold>Rule 068:</bold><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="d61662b5-d470-4fce-e554-c51669b695f5"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="ccb8cda9-5d8d-4b7a-ac68-09aaa24ef7b7" timestamp="1627507023603"?><bold>Where the buyer in a learning transaction is an individual, the LET provider shall inform the individual as to whether external constraints apply which require the individual to use a legally recognized name (LRN) as its persona as well as the nature Source Authority for such a LRN.</bold><?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="ccb8cda9-5d8d-4b7a-ac68-09aaa24ef7b7"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="136a79d0-b9f4-40fa-db60-ccd4aab83dfa" timestamp="1627507023603"?>For example, the persona presented by the individual learner for use in a learning transaction must be one which has the status of being legally recognized for use in a jurisdictional domain, (e.g., the persona as stated on a government issued birth certificate, a passport, a driver’s licence, health insurance card, etc.).<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="136a79d0-b9f4-40fa-db60-ccd4aab83dfa"?></p><p/></sec>
