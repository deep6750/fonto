The first, which is the current, traditional approach, is that of addressing each information law requirement on its own, i.e., as a "vertical silo". Here different operational areas within an organization comply with information law requirements on their own, integrate them into their applications, and deal with issues as they are identified, a crisis occurs, an audit discovers gaps, lack of compliance results in court actions, liability suits, etc. Convergence in and information communication technologies (ICT), increased the need for trustworthiness and integrity, accountability, etc., has made this "traditional" approach increasingly less viable.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="09d82e9f-1db9-429b-dfc1-9455426b1118"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="c9e058c5-5020-447e-9369-4914230c2b89" timestamp="1627508800545"?>It is vital that such an integrated approach to information life cycle management of the recorded information of an organization be senior management approved and driven. It is also very important that such ILCM principles focus on the WHATs not the HOWs and be stated in simple, non-technical language.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="c9e058c5-5020-447e-9369-4914230c2b89"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="f569f8a3-3436-412c-bac8-d33c4f3f35b8" timestamp="1627508816928"?>The eight (8) key Information Life Cycle Management (ILCM) Principles presented here incorporate a wide variety of information law requirements common to most jurisdictional domains as well as widely accepted best management practices of an "organization"<xref ref-type="fn" as:rid="chunks/82851/id-70d01489-74ad-4828-9242-f47755f73d5a.xml#id-782fefc8-eb97-4e13-8af3-baf52aa6f224" id="id-84d53805-5e77-4035-c7b0-63f30b4d2350" xmlns:as="http://niso-sts-authoring-solution/authoring-schema"><?fontoxml-text-placeholder text="type the link text"?></xref><fn id="id-782fefc8-eb97-4e13-8af3-baf52aa6f224"><p>Detailed information on the rules and implementation of the ILCM principles ,rule (and associated guidelines) are found in ISO/IEC 15944-12:2020 <italic>“Information technology – Business Operational View (BOV) – Part 12 Privacy protection requirements (PPR) on information life cycle management (ILCM) and EDI of personal information (PI)</italic>”</p></fn>.
