Consequently, for any JTC1/SC36 standard which pertains to “individuals” as participants in a learning process, to be able to be implemented and used in the jurisdictional domain of the P-member must be able, or structured to be able, to support applicable privacy protection requirements.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="4a73ee51-7901-49b2-9c79-cf2aa0b07c96"?></p><p/></sec>
