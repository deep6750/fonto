As such, Open-edi standards development, which focuses on the collaboration space among Persons and their IT systems, has from it inception, supported information life cycle management (ILCM) requirements in its standards development work. The need to reflect and support ILCM requirements is of particular importance where external constraints apply to the modelling of a learning transaction. This was reflected and explicitly supported in the development of the existing principles, rules and definitions in all the existing Parts of ISO/IEC 15944, i.e., its definitions of relevant concept, and rules and include those found in the “Characteristics of Open-edi”, those pertaining to state changes, record retention, the specification of the collaboration space, etc., as well as being found in the templates for scoping Open-edi transactions and modelling Open-edi scenarios and their components.</p><p>As such Annex C below brings forward and states explicitly the ILCM principles in support of information law compliance, i.e. external constraints, applicable to the modelling of common learning transactions via Open-edi scenarios.
