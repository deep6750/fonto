However, requirements of a “confidentiality” and “secrecy” nature would need to be identified, negotiated and agreed to as part of contract formation pertaining to a learning transaction are not in the scope of this standard, although similar methods may be used in modelling as those for privacy.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="58077aaa-4617-4da4-bfa2-ee7179ff9b07"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="d30e3f16-a4ff-4894-8fa5-3ac3b8ea12d7" timestamp="1627506552058"?>This is part of the broader field referred to as of information security labelling in ISO/IEC 27002.<xref ref-type="fn" as:rid="chunks/82851/id-5a4b0d3c-56ea-4d70-bb15-598f04052ba2.xml#id-d0f6ea41-27de-4cbd-80fd-35d46d4611d8" id="id-ddbbee03-ba7c-407a-ecdb-419ddd2d0650" xmlns:as="http://niso-sts-authoring-solution/authoring-schema"><?fontoxml-text-placeholder text="type the link text"?></xref><fn id="id-d0f6ea41-27de-4cbd-80fd-35d46d4611d8"><p>See further ISO/IEC 27002 <bold><italic>Information technology -- Security techniques -- Code of practice for information security management.</italic> In addition, the ITU-T has standards development activities pertaining to privacy protection and use of ICT, i.e., from a FSV perspective. Similar, ISO/IEC JTC1 has several standard development committees addressing privacy protection issues from both a BOV and FSV perspective, (e.g., JTC1/SC31, <underline>JTC1/SC32</underline>, and SC37) or from a FSV perspective, (e.g., ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27)</bold></p></fn> Information is labelled according to the overall privacy protection constraints that are to be applied to it. Information that is confidential is generally labelled so that supporting FSV mechanisms are able to determine if the information is being accessed by an entity that is properly authorized. Privacy protection labels (as shown in Section 5) are used to determine what subsequent use (if any) the authorized entity may make of the information that is labelled. So, at a simple level, the recipient of information that is confidential is not limited in the subsequent use that they make of that information, whilst the recipient of information that has privacy is explicitly constrained as to the subsequent use. As such, privacy protection labelling is separate and independent of confidentiality labelling although both make use of similar supporting mechanisms, (e.g., as part of LET-FSV services).<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="d30e3f16-a4ff-4894-8fa5-3ac3b8ea12d7"?></p><p/></sec>
