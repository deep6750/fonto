By way of example, in the transaction given in section 6 of a purchase and payment it may not be necessary for the LET provider to know the actual personal identity of the individual learner, but to have an identifier by which that individual learner may be uniquely identified to the LET provider. It may be sufficient that the LET provider is certain of payment because the LET provider has an authority from a third party such as a bank that the transaction will be paid. Thus the bank may need to know the identity of the individual learner and LET provider in order to fulfil its requirements in the transaction, whilst the LET provider does not need to know the identity of the individual learner.An example is the purchase by an individual of a LET software package, self-learn course material, etc., (especially where these do not involve the LET provider offering a degree, diploma, certificate, etc.). The same is true when agents are used, or when a public administration is a supervisor to a transaction, where the other parties need to know and perhaps be able to prove that the public administration was involved, but not be able to identify the individual within the public administration actually involved (although the internal functions of the public administration may need that information for their own supervisory purposes).It is noted that this rule makes provision for the possibility that the individual, as a prospective individual learner, may consent to be kept informed by the LET provider about product information, (e.g., via a catalogue), special sales, new offerings, etc. Such a decision by the individual learner is of the nature of obtaining “informed consent”.An individual learner may have provided personal information to a LET provider as part of the identification or negotiation phase. However, in this case the individual learner decided not to commit to the actualization of the learning transaction. As such the personal information provided by the individual learner to the LET provider is no longer relevant and therefore the LET provider concerned shall delete the personal information pertaining to that individual learner.Where a learning transaction did not reach the actualization phase, any personal information collected by the LET provider in support of that transaction shall be deleted by the LET provider (unless the individual learner concerned explicitly consents to the prospective LET provider to the retention of such personal information for a defined period of time).Rule 025:It is noted that where the learning transaction is one of the nature of the provision of a service or a right, (e.g., a license of some kind) that the LET provider needs to retains a specified set(s) of personal information for as long as a learning transaction of this nature remains active.It is important that when the individual learner is a party to a learning transaction, prior to and at the actualization phase in a learning transaction,, that the individual learner is fully informed of the records retention requirements and practices of the LET provider particularly as these pertain to the personal information forming part of the set(s) of recorded information. It may well occur, depending on the nature of the learning transaction, that certain types of personal information may be subject to differing records retention periods.When the learner in learning transaction is an individual, the LET provider shall inform that individual learner of the applicable record retention conditions and especially where these pertain to personal information.Rule 024:From a customer service, many LET providers (including public administrations), wish to stay in contact with their customers, i.e., individual learners, for a variety of reasons. These include providing catalogues of their offerings, possible associated goods or services, etc., as well as obtaining client feedback, surveys, new product announcements, etc.personal information which is required to actualize the learning transaction and the time period(s) for which such sets of personal information are to be retained;additional personal information, i.e., in addition to (1), which is required to be collected and retained as a result of applicable external constraints, of whatever nature, of relevant jurisdictional domain(s); and/or,additional personal information, i.e. in addition to (1) or (2), which is required to be collected and retained as a results of the invocation of an associated warranty, purchase of an extended warranty, or any other personal information which is required to be collected or retained as part of the post-actualization phase of an instantiated learning transaction.Where the individual learner in a learning transaction, the LET provider shall inform the individual learner of any and all records retention requirements of personal information which is recorded as the result of the actualization of the learning transaction, including:Rule 023:The sale of many types of goods or services, require the LET provider to inform the individual learner of possible safety and health considerations with respect to whatever was purchased. These include product recalls, repairs, verifications checking or testing of specific function or components, etc.Where the LET provider offers a warranty (e.g. in relation to mandatory equipment purchase, software packages, etc.), or extended warranty, as part of the learning transaction, the LET provider shall inform the individual learner, of the associated added records retention requirements for the personal information associated with the warranty (including the purchase by the individual learner of an extended warranty).Rule 022:The LET provider shall identify to the individual learner any and all record retention requirements pertaining the resulting sets of recorded information which form part of the specified goal of a learning transaction as a result of applicable external constraints of jurisdictional domain(s) as a result of the actualization of the learning transaction.Rule 021:The following rules summarize these requirements from a LOV perspective:In a LET context, LET providers are often required or have the long standing practice of retaining (summary) “student records” permanently, i.e., to be able to provide proof of completion of a certain level of primary, secondary schooling, obtaining a degree, a certificate, etc.It is also recognized that where the purchase of a LET good, service and/or right involves “post-actualization” aspects of a temporal nature that these will also impact record retention requirements and obligations resulting from an actualized learning transaction. A primary example here of an internal constraint nature is that of a “warranty” for “n” number of years.It is noted that in order to be able to support a “warranty” of whatever nature, the LET provider will need to maintain personal information for a time period other, i.e., longer, than that required by law, i.e. as part of the applicable external constraints of the relevant jurisdictional domain(s). This is especially so where consumers purchase an “extended warranty”.This includes the possibility that the individual learner who made the purchase may not be the “warranty holder”.For example, where the good or service purchased as a gift. The recipient of the gift, as an individual, would become the owner and also would complete the warranty information including personal information required for the warranty to be invoked.It is recognized that, depending on the nature of the LET good, service and/or right, which is the goal of the learning transaction, specified additional records retentions requirements of applicable jurisdictional domains may apply to all or specified subsets of all the recorded information pertaining to a learning transaction.For most, if not all, instantiated learning transactions, external constraints of the applicable jurisdictional domain(s) require that specific sets of recorded information (SRIs) pertaining to any learning transaction be retained by the LET provider for a specified period of time.This also means that LET providers shall have in place auditable rules and procedures as are necessary to ensure that personal information no longer required for the post-actualization phase of a learning transaction shall be destroyed (expunged) by the LET provider, or its agents where applicable, and in a manner, which can be verified via audit procedures.Personal information must be identified as having a specific ‘life’ of time of existence if this is to be other than that demanded for the purposes of national record keeping. This retention time period shall form part of the scenario definition and the time period will be explicit.Personal information shall be retained by the LET provider only for as long as is necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes as specified as part of the learning transaction.Rule 020:the individual learner may refuse consent for a secondary, derivative or new use of its personal information; but also,where an LET provider is not able to contact the individual learner concerned to make request for another use of that individual learner’s personal information, then such a proposed “new” use is not permitted.This rule requires not only that:Where the LET provider, having collected personal information for a specific purpose and goal of the execution of the learning transaction, desires to use the relevant personal information for another purpose, it is necessary to obtain revised/new “informed consent” directly from the individual learner concerned.Rule 019:In scenario definitions, this shall require that the scenario definition identify explicitly all data that are subject to this rule Other LOV processes will be required to enact this rule, so the scenario definition is required in order to identify to the party(ies) subject to this rule that they are liable for non-compliance if they fail to instantiate annual or other separate procedures in compliance with this rule.This means that the purpose for which personal information was collected or requested from an individual learner shall be directly related to, if not explicitly stated, in the mutually agreed upon and explicitly stated goal of the learning transaction being instantiated.Personal information shall not be used or disclosed by the LET provider (or regulator) for purposes other than for those it was collected as part of the learning transaction, except with the informed consent of the individual learner, or as required by law. Secondary or derivative uses of personal information are not permitted.Rule 017:Note that this rule may require that some personal data must be retained specifically for this purpose and that this purpose is implicitly necessary to a transaction involving personal data.Parties to a learning transaction are required to be able to support these six Open-edi characteristics as requirements governing the DMAs of the LET provider in their IT systems.The six key characteristics by which Open-edi is recognized and defined are:- actions based upon following rules;- commitment of the parties involved;- communications among parties automated;- parties control and maintain their states;- parties act autonomously; and,- multiple simultaneous transactions can be supported.See further Clause 5 “Characteristics of Open-edi” in ISO/IEC 15944-1. The ILCM principles reflect and support the six key characteristics of Open-edi.The integrated set of ILCM principles applies to and supports the external constraints of a privacy protection nature for any learning transaction involving an individual learner and its personal information.Rule 016:This 6th Privacy Protection Principle consolidates and integrates what are considered “generic, primitive” Information Life Cycle Management (ILCM) principles which apply to any and all types of sets of recorded information (SRIs) within a LET provider (including public administrations) and among LET providers. This addresses the “collaboration space” among all parties, i.e., types of Person, to a learning transaction; As such, Annex D below titled “Integrated set of information life cycle management principles in support of information law compliance” applies to these privacy protection principles.[3]) The integrated set of information life cycle management (ILCM) principles in support of information law compliance, which apply to data management and interchange generally also apply to Open-ediWhile the focus here is on “Electronic data interchange (EDI)”, these ILCM principles apply to any internal or external constraints applicable to any. set of recorded information (SRI) of any Person within and among Persons ( and their IT systems). In addition, Annex E below titled “Coded domains for the management and control of state changes, retention and destruction of personal information in commitment exchange, including learning transactions” supports both the implementation of the ILCM principles as well as privacy protection requirements.Privacy Protection Principle 6: Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention" timestamp="1627500447144"?><p/><?fontoxml-change-deletion author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="aa3824db-0759-49c6-892b-2d2f013897d7" text="As such Annex C below brings forward and states explicitly the ILCM principles in support of information law compliance, i.e. external constraints, applicable to the modelling of common learning transactions via Open-edi scenarios.
