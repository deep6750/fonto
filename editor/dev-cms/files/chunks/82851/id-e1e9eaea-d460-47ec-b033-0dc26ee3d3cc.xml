The two other existing strategic directions are "portability" and "interoperability". Not all ISO/IEC JTC1 standards are being provided in more than one language, i.e., in addition to "ISO English," in part due to resource constraints.<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="8ed0c1dc-9c51-44ee-d87d-948d87f1a7c7"?></p><p><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="723fee19-2229-4cd3-dd6d-5e690580d0d9" timestamp="1627508123597"?>Terms and definitions are an essential part of a standard. This Annex serves to support the "cultural adaptability" aspects of standards as required by ISO/IEC JTC1. Its purpose is to ensure that if, for whatever reason, an ISO/IEC JTC1 standard is developed in one ISO/IEC "official" language only, at the minimum the terms and definitions are made available in more than one language.<xref ref-type="fn" as:rid="chunks/82851/id-e1e9eaea-d460-47ec-b033-0dc26ee3d3cc.xml#id-38ccb5e9-5f43-402e-954e-633d3e1715e8" id="id-6f1113db-8c3e-473c-ff92-b05c70714c81" xmlns:as="http://niso-sts-authoring-solution/authoring-schema"><?fontoxml-text-placeholder text="type the link text"?></xref><fn id="id-38ccb5e9-5f43-402e-954e-633d3e1715e8"><p>Other ISO/IEC member bodies are encouraged to provide bilingual/multilingual equivalencies of terms/definitions for the language(s) in use in their countries.</p></fn> A key benefit of translating terms and definitions is that such work in providing bilingual/multilingual equivalency:<?fontoxml-change-addition-end change-id="723fee19-2229-4cd3-dd6d-5e690580d0d9"?></p><list list-type="order"><?fontoxml-change-addition-start author-id="andres@nii.ac.jp" change-id="5a1cd067-0e36-45f8-fa5c-4f94131c8bf0" timestamp="1627508113283"?><list-item id="id-6d1601ce-79a0-4eb6-dcf5-092858149cd0"><p>should be considered a "quality control check" in that establishing an equivalency in another language ferrets out "hidden" ambiguities in the source language.
